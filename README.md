# Kaizen TypeScript Example

This example repo covers some libraries on how to use them with TypeScript

## Library List
- [React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/typescript)
- [Redux](https://redux.js.org/usage/usage-with-typescript#standard-redux-toolkit-project-setup-with-typescript)
- [Axios](https://dev.to/limacodes/why-using-axios-with-typescript-1fnj)
- [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/docs/typescript)
- [React Native Config](https://github.com/luggit/react-native-config#typescript-declaration-for-your-env-file)
- [React Query](https://tanstack.com/query/v3/docs/react/overview) I wanted to create a sample project for React Query. You can check out [this link](https://tkdodo.eu/blog/thinking-in-react-query) to get an idea. I could not use mutations because the api I use does not have a post endpoint
- [Zod](https://zod.dev/) I validated the backend response with Zod library. With this way we will have 100% valid data in the app and this will reduce crashes from backend.

## Features
- Routing
- FlatList
- State management with Redux
- Backend response validate
- Caching with React Query
- Custom hooks
- Type declaration for React Native Config
